### TODO/ideas list
- cache which pictures have been recently shown such that when you change a setting and the wallpaper reloads, you don't have to see pictures you've seen already again before seeing new ones.
- reload feature such that you don't have to re-select the wallpaper from the list in order for some settings to update
  - reset option for this
- blocklist / favourite list using localstorage
	- export options: copy to clipboard
		- plaintext list
		- plaintext list (minimal, only urls)

		- add to blocklist when downvoting
		- add to reddit account hidden when downvoting/blocking
		- don't show items from hidden
